What?

Well I could have said “the current version of Ubuntu” but that doesn’t begin with a Q.

For the uninitiated, Ubuntu is a computer operating system based on Linux. It’s what I’m currently using to write this post. As the majority of the internet runs on Linux-based machines, it makes sense for web developers to use the environment they’ll be deploying to when they develop. Whilst most of the tools I use in dev work are available for Windows, almost without exception they’re better and easier to use in Linux. It also ties in to the Open Source ethos, Linux machines are regarded as far more secure than Windows machines; No viruses (virii?), exploits that get patched within hours of being found, and the freedom to hack on it if you want.

But Quantal Quetxal? As well as having proper version numbers (the current one being 12.10), Ubuntu releases are also given code words. The last few include Precise Pangolin, Oneiric Ocelot, Natty Narwhal and Maverick Meerkat. In another few years they’ll be able to take part in the A-to-Z Challenge themselves!
