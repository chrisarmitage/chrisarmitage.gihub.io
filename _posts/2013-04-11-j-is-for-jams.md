Raspberry Jams to be specific.

If you’re not familiar with the Raspberry Pi, it’s a credit card-sized computer on the market for around £25. It has a few significant features: extremely low power usage, it has a row of pins that allow you to hook your own electrical wires directly up to the main board, and it’s size / cost mean it’s feasible for an entire class in a school to have their own for projects.

It’s been heavily targeted at the education sector with an aim of getting children interesting in the inner-workings of computers at an early age. As it stands, schools are only really teaching children how to operate a computer, not how the machine itself operates. This is heading towards a shortage of computer engineers and developers entering the industry in years to come.

But because the Raspberry Pi is so open-ended, it took some fairly creative people to work out just what you could actually do with one and then pass that information on to other people. Enter the Raspberry Jams.

At its simplest, get a load of people who are either existing programmers / engineers and can comfortably sit down with new technology and tinker with it, and a group of people who lack the skills but have the passion to learn. I’ve attended the [Manchester Raspberry Jam](http://mcrraspjam.org.uk/) a few times now, and I’ve gone from having an introduction to the Python programming language (one of the main languages on the Pi) to teaching others the basics, along with helping beginners getting their machines set up and sharing what I learnt about using the direct wiring pins. It may have only been a flashing LED, but it represented running hardware directly from software, something which is pretty much impossible on modern computers.

The overall theme is that knowledge should be shared freely, something which my belief in strengthens every time I can help steer someone in the right direction and the following month they’ve had the confidence to carry on learning and end up teaching me a thing or two.
