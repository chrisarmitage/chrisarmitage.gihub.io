This is the bane of many a developers life, yet frustratingly it seems to hold true the majority of the time.

In the past I’ve spent the second 90 percent doing jobs that, on their own, would have taken no more than ten minutes. But fitting them in around the now almost complete codebase without breaking anything means they drag out to be a three-day job.

One thing I’m curious about is if any other areas suffer from this. I know any projects run by the government will normally fall in to this territory, both time-wise and the cost. I’ve never heard of the last 10 percent of a knitted scarf taking 90 percent of the time, but it must happen sometimes. Any other A-to-Z challenge bloggers experience this in their chosen fields?
