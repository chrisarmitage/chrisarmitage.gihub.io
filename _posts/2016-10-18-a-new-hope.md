After a few attempts to get back into blogging, it seems one of the weak points was all the time spent trying to format a Wordpress post properly. After some snooping and playing, I've got Jekyll set up properly, so I'll (hopefully) be moving over to this.

Of course, that's reliant on finding time and having interesting topics to post about...

@TODO

1. Finish the general design, dig out an old logo from somewhere
2. Work out how to use tags
3. Work out how to allow comments (Disqus seems to be the solution of choice)
4. Start writing some shiny content!
