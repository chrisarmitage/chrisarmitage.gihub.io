By trade I’m a PHP developer, and by far the best way I improve myself is going to conferences.

It was 2010 I finally took the plunge and bought myself a ticket to PHPNW, one of the biggest PHP conferences in the UK. I didn’t know anyone, couldn’t really contribute anything to the discussions, and felt way out of my depth most of the day.

Three years and seven conferences later, I’m now planning on presenting my own talk at the PHP Unconference in Germany in May. I’ve not done public speaking before, and haven’t trained anyone in many a year, but after all I’ve received from the conference community it’s about time I gave something back.

But conferences aren’t just for the devoted programmer. I’ve attended two BarCamps, a free-for-all where the talks aren’t decided until the morning, and can be about absolutely anything. In the last two years I’ve seen talks on The History of Error Messages, Propositional Logic, Hama Beads and Engaging Children in Early Education.

BarCamps are run all over the world, so if you fancy learning brand new things for the simple pleasure of learning something new, have a search for when your local ones are.
