No, I didn’t just mash the keyboard… It stands for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.

Being a programmer and being a geek kinda go hand-in-hand. And whilst Dungeons and Dragons is by far the most popular, I tend to learn towards WFRP. Mainly because it isn’t just a hack and slash, especially how our group play it. We get a lot more in to the “roleplaying” aspect of it. If you want to find out if the victim had any enemies by talking to the bar tender, it’s not a case of rolling some dice, you better start talking and hope you can steer the conversation in the right direction.

The whole system has a double appeal to me too, as there’s a wealth of source material and a whole lot of random tables you can roll up. There’s over 100 entries on just a simple mutations chart! And to a programmer, that’s like a waving flag to a bull. I’ve already got some code in place which can generate details in fractions of a second, opposed to the 20 minutes is can take to roll through the tables manually.

Like a few other posts in the A-to-Z challenge, I hope to run a series of posts on this topic once the challenge is over, and hopefully see who else mixes swords and code.
