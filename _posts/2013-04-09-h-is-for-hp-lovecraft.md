Time for a non-tech post. Readers of a nervous disposition, consult with your doctor before continuing…

Howard Phillips Lovecraft is generally regarded as one of the greatest horror writers. He is most known for his cosmic horror stories, tales of old gods of immense power, who don’t give even a fleeting thought to the insignificant human race. From great Cthulhu, who lies sleeping in the corpse city of R’yleh at the bottom of the ocean with the power to drive a mortal mind insane, to Dagon the fish god, still worshipped in certain coastal towns where the lineage of local patrons is a subject of silent revulsion. Though little is known of Shub Niggurath, The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young, she is still worshipped by many ancient fertility cults in the darker regions of the world.

These are only a few of the many deities and horrors HP Lovecraft created in his stories, creating a mythos that endures to this day, with modern stories set in his universe and devoted fans who may be spending a little too much time trying to learn the Yog Sothoth summoning chant (hey, the pronunciation is really hard on a human throat!)

However it’s some of his other tales that I find myself remembering on cold dark nights. Rats in the Walls is one of a handful of stories to genuinely scare me, and the Herbert West stories have an eerie not-quite-fiction feel about them. And if you’re a dog lover, don’t read The Hound or you may never again hear your pooch howling without having a shiver down your spine.

You can pick up anthologies of his works at most book sellers now, so if you fancy a view into a twisted mind, pick some up and prepare to lose your sanity.
