There's a reason a load of posts have suddenly appeared from 2013. In a previous attempt to start blogging more, I entered the A-to-Z blogging challenge.
Straight forward enough, post once a day during April, with each post based around a letter of the alphabet. It was fun, but alas didn't get me into blogging as I'd hoped.

It does, however, provide some great content to start playing with. A couple of posts had photos and videos, and various ones had source code in them. So I've imported them (manually) to help me iron out any issues with the design.
