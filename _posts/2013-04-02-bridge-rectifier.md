[Bridge Rectifier](http://www.bridgerectifier.org.uk/) is the clever name for one of my local hackspaces, based in Hebden Bridge.

At the moment, they’re without a permanent home (a hackspace group without a hackspace?) so they’ve been running monthly workshops at the town hall. In the past two months I’ve learned how to build a [micro-computer for under £5](http://shrimping.it/blog/) and the basics of [3D printing](http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page). I even got to print out a scaled-down version of a shot glass.

Later on this month is an introduction to wearable computing, sewing the circuitry directly into your clothing. The idea is with these three disciplines under my belt, I can create whatever my caffeine-fuelled mind can think of!

Hopefully, following the success of these courses, the group will be looking at setting up a permanent base of operations; the hackspace. Think of it as a beefed-up school CDT lab, with woodworking, metalworking and electronic equipment. They’ll already have the 3D printer available from the previous workshop (while I was learning the basics, another team built one from scratch), and if they’re super lucky, a laser cutter.

But more importantly, it’s a place for people to come together, share ideas and skills, and help each other further themselves.
